# The whole-project proof of mago convert, which sharp/bin/test runs after the PHP# suite. Copies the fixture project
# into the empty folder $1, installs it, commits it to a fresh git repository and converts the files below, then checks
# that:
# - `--dry-run` changes no file
# - each file mago convert refuses stays plain PHP, and every other file converts
# - the index holds each conversion as a rename alone, `R100`, and `git log --follow` reaches the plain PHP file
# - `mago compile` accepts every file, the plain PHP subclasses of converted classes included
# - `mago analyze` has no new error, and only the warnings decision 9 expects
# - run.php prints the same output on the engine before and after
# - a class hierarchy converts in either order, and compiles and runs the same after each file
# Needs the engine and mago built by sharp/bin/build and sharp/bin/build-mago, and Composer and a php on PATH for the
# refinement worker, whose SDK packages it installs. Writes each step's output beside $1. Exits 1 at the first check that fails.
