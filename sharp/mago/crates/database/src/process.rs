//! Every process Mago starts, one at a time.
//!
//! `spawn`, `output` and `status` start a process as `Command`'s methods of the same names do, under one lock, and
//! every process Mago starts goes through them. macOS has no `pipe2`, so `Command::spawn` creates each pipe of a process
//! before it marks the pipe close-on-exec. A process another thread starts in between inherits the pipe and holds it
//! open for as long as it runs. A worker that closed its stdin then still takes Mago's writes, and the stdout of a
//! worker that died stays open, so its requests wait for their deadline rather than fail with what the worker wrote. A
//! pool starts its workers at once. On a loaded Mac, 30 of 300 processes that closed their stdin while another thread
//! kept starting processes still took a write, and none did under this lock. Go's `syscall.ForkLock` holds the same
//! steps apart. This crate is the lowest one every crate that starts a process depends on.
